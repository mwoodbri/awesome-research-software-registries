# Awesome Research Software Registries [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

A list of research software registries (also known as catalog, index, warehouse,
repository, hub, platform, and other terms).

We define a registry as any publicly accessible website where research software
can be registered, and that employs Search Engine Optimization such as the
addition of metadata to help promote discovery of the research software that is
published on the registry. Websites do not necessarily have to retain their own
copies of the research software itself in order to be included in the list
below.

## Contribute

Help us expand the list of research software registries by [sending us a Pull
Request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request).

When suggesting a link, note that eligible registries have at least some of
the following properties:

1. The registry includes metadata about each software package (check the link using
   [Google's structured data testing tool](https://search.google.com/structured-data/testing-tool)).
2. The registry includes links to a copy of the software, e.g. on GitHub, or Bitbucket.
3. The registry includes a human-readable description of what each software does. Having just the name
   of software is not sufficient, as this is not helping visitors judge if the
   software will help them solve their problem.
4. The registry includes contextual information about the software, e.g. papers, blogs, presentations,
   posters, or videos associated with it.
5. The registry contains more than just a handful of software packages.
